      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: 4 January 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription Manager (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a mobile application built for businesses to record, manage,
        and monitor subscription sales and customer data. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect,
        why we collect it, how the information is used and protected, and what permissions the application requires.
        By accessing or using this application, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>2. Who Can Use This App</h2>
      <p>
        Access to the app is restricted to authenticated users only. Users are required to sign up and log in using
        email and password authentication. Each user can access only their own data. Anonymous access to the application
        is not permitted.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>3. Purpose of the Application</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the application is to enable authorized users to record and manage subscription-based business
        data. The app allows users to record monthly or yearly subscription sales, automatically calculate subscription
        expiry dates, track active and expired subscriptions, search customers using email addresses or phone numbers,
        and view purchase and activity history. Users can also soft-delete and restore subscription records, export
        business data such as users, purchases, and extra emails via email.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>4. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Account and Authentication Information</h3>
      <p>
        We collect certain account-related information through Firebase Authentication. This includes the user’s email
        address and a unique user identifier (UID). This information is used solely for login and authentication
        purposes, enforcing user-level data access, validating export requests, and enabling role-based access control
        such as admin and standard user permissions.
      </p>

      <h3>Subscription and Customer Data</h3>
      <p>
        When a user adds a subscription record, the application may store customer-related information including the
        customer’s email address, phone number with country code, selected subscription plan (monthly or yearly), amount
        paid, purchase date, and the subscription expiry date calculated by the app. All such data is entered manually
        by the user and is used strictly for subscription tracking and internal business management.
      </p>

      <h3>Extra Email Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        Users may optionally store additional email addresses within the app for business reports. The system prevents
        duplicate email entries at the data level to maintain accuracy and consistency.
      </p>

      <h3>Export and Audit Metadata</h3>
      <p>
        When a user requests a data export, the app stores metadata related to that request. This includes the requested
        email address, the type of export (users, purchases, or extra emails), the export status, timestamps related to
        the request lifecycle, the total number of records included, and any error messages generated during processing.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>5. How We Use the Data</h2>
      <p>
        All collected information is used strictly to operate and improve the core functionality of the application.
        This includes displaying subscription data within the app, calculating subscription status, enabling searching,
        filtering, and analytics, generating and delivering export files via email, restoring recently deleted records,
        and maintaining audit logs for export activity. We do not sell, rent, share, or use any data for advertising,
        profiling, or marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        All data is stored securely using Firebase services. Authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication,
        and application data is stored in Firebase Firestore with owner-based access rules to ensure data isolation.
        Export files are generated using secure Cloud Functions, stored privately, and delivered only via email. Direct
        client access to export files is blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscription records that are soft-deleted are marked as deleted and hidden from primary views. These records
        are retained for up to 30 days, during which they can be restored. After this retention period, the records are
        permanently deleted.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. App Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        The application does not request access to sensitive device permissions such as the camera, microphone,
        location, contacts, SMS, call logs, or file and media storage. The only required permission is internet access,
        which is necessary for authentication, data synchronization, and export generation and delivery.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription Manager uses trusted third-party services to provide core functionality. These include Firebase for
        authentication, database storage, cloud functions, and secure file handling, as well as SendGrid for delivering
        export files via email. These services process data only to the extent required to perform their intended
        functions.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Active data is retained until it is deleted by the user. Soft-deleted data is retained for a period of 30 days
        before being permanently removed. Export-related records are retained only for audit purposes and delivery
        tracking.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This application is not intended for use by children and does not target users under the age of 13.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>11. User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the data they enter into the application. Users must
        ensure that they have the appropriate rights and permissions to store customer information. Users can delete or
        restore records within the app, and access to data is restricted to the user’s own records unless administrative
        privileges are granted.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated”
        date at the top of this page.
      </p>

      <hr />
