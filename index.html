    </header>

    <section class="section" id="introduction">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Subscription Manager (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a mobile application built for business users to record, manage, and monitor subscription sales and customer data.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and protected, and what permissions the application requires. By accessing or using this application, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="who-can-use">
      <h2>2. Who Can Use This App</h2>
      <p>Access to the application is restricted to authenticated users only. Users must sign up and log in using email and password authentication. Each user can access only their own data. Anonymous access to the application is not permitted.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="purpose">
      <h2>3. Purpose of the Application</h2>
      <p>The application enables authorized users to record and manage subscription-based business data. It allows users to record monthly or yearly subscription sales, automatically calculate subscription expiry dates, track active and expired subscriptions, search customers using email addresses or phone numbers, and view purchase and activity history.</p>
      <p>Users can also soft-delete and restore subscription records and export business data (such as purchase records) via email.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="information-we-collect">
      <h2>4. Information We Collect</h2>

      <p class="subhead">Account and Authentication Information</p>
      <p>We collect certain account-related information through Firebase Authentication, including the user’s email address, optional display name, role (standard user), and a unique user identifier (UID). This information is used for login, authentication, enforcing user-level data access, and validating export requests.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Subscription and Customer Data</p>
      <p>When a user adds subscription records, the application may store customer-related information such as customer email address, phone number with country code, subscription plan (monthly or yearly), amount paid, purchase date, and the calculated subscription expiry date.</p>
      <p>Each record also includes owner metadata (ownerId and ownerEmail) and audit fields (createdAt, isDeleted, deletedAt, deletedBy) to enforce access control and support recovery. All such data is entered manually by the user and is used strictly for subscription tracking and business management.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Export and Audit Metadata</p>
      <p>When a user requests a data export, the application stores metadata related to the request, including request ID, owner details, requested email address, export type, export status, timestamps, timezone, total number of records included, file paths for generated export files, and any error messages generated during processing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="how-we-use-data">
      <h2>5. How We Use the Data</h2>
      <p>All collected information is used strictly to operate and improve the core functionality of the application. This includes displaying subscription data, calculating subscription status, enabling search and filtering, generating and delivering export files via email, restoring deleted records, and maintaining audit logs.</p>
      <p>We do not sell, rent, share, or use any data for advertising, profiling, or marketing purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="storage-security">
      <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>All data is stored securely using Firebase services. Authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication, and application data is stored in Firebase Firestore with owner-based access rules to ensure data isolation.</p>
      <p>Export files are generated using secure Cloud Functions, stored privately in Firebase Storage under paths such as <code>exports/{requestId}/</code>, and sent only to the authenticated user’s registered email address. These files are not accessible by other users, and direct client access is blocked by storage rules.</p>
      <p>Soft-deleted subscription records are retained for up to 30 days, during which they can be restored. After this period, cleanup routines permanently delete the data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="permissions">
      <h2>7. App Permissions</h2>
      <p>The application does not request access to sensitive device permissions such as camera, microphone, location, contacts, SMS, call logs, or file and media storage. The only required permission is internet access, which is necessary for authentication, data synchronization, and export delivery.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="third-party">
      <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The application does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies for user profiling, behavioral tracking, or marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>Backend logging or monitoring is limited strictly to operational needs such as security, error detection, and service reliability. Trusted third-party services used include Firebase for authentication, database storage, cloud functions, and secure file handling, and SendGrid for delivering export files via email. These services process data only to the extent required to perform their intended functions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="retention">
      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Active data is retained until deleted by the user. Soft-deleted data is retained for 30 days before permanent removal. Export-related records are retained only for audit purposes and delivery tracking.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="children">
      <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>This application is not intended for use by children and does not target users under the age of 13.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="user-responsibility">
      <h2>11. User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>Users are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the data they enter into the application. Users must ensure that they have the appropriate rights and permissions to store customer information.</p>
      <p>Users can access, modify, export, or delete their own data at any time directly within the application. The app acts solely as a data processor for business data entered by users and does not independently collect, verify, or source customer information. Users are solely responsible for ensuring lawful collection, use, and storage of any customer data entered into the application, including obtaining any required consent under applicable data protection laws.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="changes">
      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.</p>
    </section>
